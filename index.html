                        Edinburgh is “where the major cultural institutions are clustered, and also where the festivals happen” (Currie, 3:13).

                    <p class="whiteText">
                        Currie says that the purpose of this project is to map places like art museums and cultural areas in the city of Edinburgh (Currie, 5:00).
                        The goal of the project was to understand where the important places including museums, art galleries, and gathering places were.
                        She describes the outcomes of the project, which include “understanding the cultural differences across Edinburgh” (Currie, 6:47),
                        and that the project was guided by a series of questions related to Edinburgh’s culture (Currie, 7:20).

                        These sculptures are placed all across Western’s campus and are permanent (Sculpture).
                        Particularly notable is the Wright’s Triangle sculpture by Richard Serra
                        (Wright's Triangle).  Pictured here is not Wright's Triangle, but "Big Chair."

                        The project then created surveys, stored the feedback, and added that data to the data (Currie, 13:52).

                        These projects influenced and inspired the Edinburgh Culture & Communities Mapping Project (Currie, 11:30).

                        Currie shows the data as it is collected on the map and displayed on the Edinburgh Culture Map webpage (Currie, 28:02).
                        Currie says the map inspired the creation of LeithLate Virtual Tours, another map of art drawn on buildings made possible by the community mapping (Currie, 32:06).
                        The project will continue by recording more data that may be useful for helping more people visit and appreciate important places and events (Currie, 34:50).
                        Currie describes the project’s goals as not just creating maps, but creating a difference in the world (Currie, 35:00).
